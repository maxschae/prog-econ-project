## Treatment effect estimation in Regression Discontinuity Designs

In this project we assess parametric and non-parametric methods to assess
treatment effect estimation in RDD. In particular, (local) linear and polynomial
regression models are investigated through a Monte Carlo simulation study, and
further challenged in a real data application.
