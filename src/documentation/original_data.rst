The dataset used to replicate results from *Does Extending Unemployment Benefits
Improve Job Quality?* by Nekoei and Weber (2017) and to apply different estimation
procedures is a subset of the administrative social security record data from the
Austrian Social Security Database. It covers individual observations on private
sector job separations in Austria for the period of 1980â€“2011 and people aged 30
to 50 years. It contains 1,738,787 observations.

Due to Github's restriction on the file size, we only include a subset of the
original data provided by the authors in **src.original_data**. The file
*Data_public_small.dta* excludes the variables that we do not need for our analysis
such that it comprises the following variables:

* *monthly_wage_0*: Monthly wage in the old job.
* *monthly_wage_n0*: Monthly wage in the new job.
* *age*: Age of the individual at the time of layoff.
* *ned*: Non-employment duration computed as the number of days between the end of a lost job and the start of a new job.
* *wg_c*: Wage change between pre- and post-unemployment jobs computed as the log difference between daily wage in the year of separation and in the year when the new job started.
