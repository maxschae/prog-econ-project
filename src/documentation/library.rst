.. _library:

************
Code library

The directory *src.library* provides code that may be used by different steps of the analysis. Little code snippets for input / output or stuff that is not directly related to the model would go here.

Example: The distinction from the :ref:`data_analysis` directory is a bit arbitrary, but I have found it useful in the past.
