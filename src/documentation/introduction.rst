Introduction

Our project investigates the performance difference of parametric towards
non-parametric methods when estimating the effect of a binary treatment on an
outcome of interest in the setup of sharp Regression Discontinuity Designs.

Considering different model specifications, we highlight the weaknesses and
strengths of the single estimation methods in a simulation study using Python.
Further, we employ the investigated methods to a real world example in a data
application.

This documentation contains an overview and brief description of the different
files and implemented functions contained in our project's
`Github repository <https://github.com/maxschae/prog-econ-project/>`_ .
