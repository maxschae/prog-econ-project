Introduction

Our project investigates the performance difference of parametric towards
non-parametric estimation methods when estimating the effect of a binary
treatment on an outcome of interest in the setup of sharp Regression
Discontinuity Designs.

Considering different model specifications, we highlight the weaknesses and
strengths of the single estimation methods in a Monte Carlo simulation study
using Python. Further, we employ the investigated methods to a real world
example in a data application.

This documentation contains an overview and brief description of the different
files and implemented functions contained in our Github repository
